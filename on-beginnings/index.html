        <div class="card header">On Beginnings</div>
        <div class="card fivevh">In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.</div>
        <div class="card threevh">In poetry, the number of  <span class="test bgt">beginnings</span> so far exceeds the number of <span class="test smt">endings</span> that we cannot even conceive of it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <span>Not every poem is finished</span>
        </div>
        <div class="card">one poem is <span class="test disappear">abandoned</span></div>
        <div class="card fivevh">another <span class="test fire">catches fire</span> and is carried away by the wind</div>
        <div class="card shorterline">
            <p>which may be an ending,</p>
            <p>but it is the ending of a poem without an end.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="card sevenvh">Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely</div>
        <div class="card twovh">abandoned
        </div>
        <div class="card">This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud. </div>
        <div class="card">Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so <span>vividly</span>, and to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it</div>
        <div class="card">
            <p>the opening line of a poem,</p>
            <p> he said,</p>
            <p>is like finding a fruit on the ground</p>
        </div>
        <div class="shorterline">
            <p class="card">a</p>
            <p class="card">piece</p>
            <p class="card"> of</p>
            <p class="card">fallen</p>
            <p class="card">fruit</p>
            <p class="card">you</p>
            <p class="card">have</p>
            <p class="card">never</p>
            <p class="card">seen</p>
            <p class="card">before</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">and the poet’s task is to create the <div class="test tree">tree</div> from which such a fruit would fall.</div>

        <div class="spacer"></div>
         <div class="card">In the beginning was the Word.</div>
        <div class="card">Western civilization rests upon those words.</div>

        <div class="card threevh">And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act, that nothing can precede action</div>
        <div class="card">no <span class="test appear">breath</span> before act</div>
        <div class="card">no <span class="test appear">thought</span> before act</div>
        <div class="card threevh">no <span class="test appear">pervasive love</span> before some kind of act</div>
        <div class="card">I believe the poem is an act of the mind.</div>
        <div class="card">I think it is easier to talk about the end of </div>
        <div class="card">a poem than it is to talk about its beginning.</div>
        <div class="card threevh"> Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the</div>
        <div class="card threevh"><div class="test color">mind.</div></div>
        <div class="card">The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will;</div>
        <div class="card">somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.</div>
        <div class="card twovh">An act of the mind.</div>
        <div class="card">
            To <div class="test move">move,</div>
            <p>to make happen, </p>
            <p>to make manifest</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">Be an act of Congress.</div>
        <div class="card"> A state of real existence rather than possibility</div>
        <div class="card"> And poets <span class="test red">love</span> possibility!</div> 
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="card fivevh test wdr">They love to wonder and explore</div>
        <div class="card">But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist!</div>
        <div class="card">To conduct oneself, to behave.</div>
        <div class="card">How a poem acts marks its

        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="card">A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure.</div>
        <div class="card">to pretend, feign, impersonate</div>
        <div class="card twovh"> That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. </div>
        <div class="card threevh">As the poet Ralph angel puts it,</div>
        <div class="card threevh">“The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.”
        </div>
        <div class="card">the weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives;</div>
        <div class="card">theater requires that you draw a circle around the <span class="test circle">action</span> and observe it from outside the circle;
        </div>
        <div class="card">in other words, self-consciousness is theatre.</div>
        <div class="card">Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same</div>
        <div class="card threevh">
          <p>a(n) <span class="test spin"></span></p>
          <!-- <p>a <span class="test appear">line</span></p>
          <p>a <span class="test appear">scrap of language</span></p>
          <p>a <span class="test appear">rhythm</span></p>
          <p>an <span class="test appear">image</span></p> -->
          <p>something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">And the lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn:</div>
        <div class="card">if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent,</div>
        <div class="card"> 
          <div>you are on the wrong path,</div>
          <div>a dead-end alley,</div>
          <div>at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="card threevh"><span class="test strikethrough">This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.</span></div>
        <div class="card fivevh">I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.</div>
        <div class="card fivevh">Now here is something really interesting (to me),
            <p>
            something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are <span class="test number"></span> words used by the Esimo for snow.
          <p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
           This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa:
        </div>
        <div class="card">Some languages are so constructed—English among them— that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime.</div>
        <div class="card">That sentence begins with your first words, 
        <div class="inline">
            <div class="test b">toddling</div> 
            <div class="test o">around</div>
            <div class="test u">the</div>
            <div class="test n">kitchen,</div>
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card">and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand.</div>
        <div class="card">Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to 
            <div class="inline">
                <div class="test disappear one">hear</div>
                <div class="test disappear two">the</div>

                <div class="test disappear four">end.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="card threevh">When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said:</div>
        <div class="card threevh">“That’s a lot of semicolons!”</div>
        <div class="card halfvh">he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being</div>
        <div class="card smalltext halfvh">an Italian as a matter of fact</div>
        <div class="card sevenvh">that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated. 
</div>
        <div class="card twovh">You might say a poem is a semicolon,</div>
        <div class="card twovh"><div class="test living">a living semicolon,</div></div>
        <div class="card">what connects the first line to the last,</div>
        <div class="card"><span class="test gap">the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart.</span></div>
        <div class="card">Between the first and last lines there exists a poem
        </div>
        <div class="card">and if it were not for the poem that intervenes,</div>
        <div class="card">the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other.</div>
        <div class="card">Would not speak to each other because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other, not you to them or they to you.</div>

        <div class="card fivevh bold">The End</div>
        <div class="card">It was its own thrill.</div>
        <div class="card threevh">I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book. 
        </div>
        <div class="card">I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End.</div>
        <div class="card fivevh">Why is that, I wonder.</div>
        <div class="card"> I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy,</div>
        <div class="card fivevh"><div class="test rope">no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line.</div></div>
        <div class="card">And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade,</div>
        <div class="card twovh">and at the bottom of the page, in <span class="bold">India ink</span>, beautifully apart from the rest of the text, were the words</div>
        <div class="card twovh">The End.</div>
        <div class="card">And I realized children very often denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written anything,</div>
        <div class="card">and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been written; they know some, of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet.</div>
        <div class="card">And so they sign their poems and stories like kings.</div>
        <div class="card">Which is a wonderful thing.</div>

        <div class="card threevh">Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing:</div>
        <div class="card"><div class="test disappear">the ending will have the last</div> word</div>
        <div class="card">the ending will be <div class="test disappear">silent</div></div>
        <div class="card fivevh"><div class="tart squared animation">the ending will execute a pirouette, do something unexpectedly incongruent.</div></div>
        <div class="card">Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: We begin in admiration and we end by organizing our disappointment.</div>
        <div class="card">the moment of admiration is the experience of something <span class="test green">unfiltered, vital and fresh</span>—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification;</div>
        <div class="card twovh">the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, think about it.</div>
        <div class="card">I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe that, then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, not the word.</div>

        <div class="card">The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper:
            <p>“The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say.</div>
        <div class="card">Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante.</div>
        <div class="card fivevh">Many men and women have written lo<span class="test long"></span>ng essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work.</div>
        <div class="card">Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: origins (beginnings) have consequences (endings).</div>
        <div class="card">The poem is the <i>consequence</i> of its origins.</div>
        <div class="card fivevh">Give me the fruit and I will take from it a seed and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell.</div>
        <div class="card">Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this:</div>
        <div class="card fivevh">“Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also <div class="test grow">fulfilled</div>."</div>
        <div class="card">But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin.</div>
        <div class="card threevh">How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace?</div>
        <div class="card threevh"> It is exactly like tracing the moment of the <span class="test bang">big bang</span></div>
        <div class="card">we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, before the universe burst into being,</div>
        <div class="card"> but we can’t go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge,</div>
        <div class="card">and we can’t <i>“know”</i> anything before <i>“knowing”</i> itself was born.</div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="card">I have flipped through books,</div>
        <div class="card"> reading hundreds of opening and closing lines,</div>
        <div class="card">across <span class="test across"></span></div>
        <div class="card threevh"> and I have discovered that first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated, and that last lines are remarkably similar, even repeated.</div>
        <div class="card threevh">Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, because the words belong to completely different poems.</div>
        <div class="card">And i began to realize, reading these first and last lines, that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each speak </div>
        <div class="card">but also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, by those we listen to.</div>
        <div class="card sevenvh">And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same: in poem after poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear as children repeated night after night, like a refrain:</div>

            <div class="test appear one">I love you.</div>

        </i></div>
        <div class="card sevenvh">And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on earth</div>
